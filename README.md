# CSS Battle
## My css battle (cssbattle.dev) code, includes easy-to-read and/or optimised code

### "Optimised" code
 - obviously not the shortest solution
 - shortest I could write when trying the qn
 - might shorten it further (sooner or later) - except those qns where the code is truly optimised (eg. Battle 1 Target 1)
 - in the format "optimised_<chars>.txt"
 
### "Easy-to-read" code
 - used some shortcuts like "body" -> "*"
 - in the format "easy2read_<chars>.txt"
  
### Truly optimised code (eg. same as leaderboard no.1)
 - Battle 1 Target 1
